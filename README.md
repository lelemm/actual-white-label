## Getting Started

Actual White Label is a white label app framework for building local-first app solutions. It is 100% free and open-source, written in NodeJS, it has a synchronization element so that all your changes can move between devices without any heavy lifting.

## Installation

Fool, use this to build your app, not to host it.
This was a stripped down from [Actual Budget](https://actualbudget.org). This is the real app, not this one

### Code structure

The Actual app is split up into a few packages:

- loot-core - The core application that runs on any platform
- desktop-client - The desktop UI
- desktop-electron - The desktop app
